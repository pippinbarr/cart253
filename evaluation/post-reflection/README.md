## Brief

⚠️ Under construction ⚠️

Write a focused, roughly 1,000 word essay that explores your past, present and potential future relationship to programming as a creative form of expression. The essay should:

* With the advantage of hindsight, briefly characterize the state of our programming knowledge at the start of this course.
* Next, discuss aspects of your new programming experiences in the course that you find exciting in connection with your personal approach to creativity. This can include elements that you are comfortable with, but also things you're challenged by but want to work on incorporating into your creative coding practice.
* Describe one or more big ideas you're interesting in exploring in the future that will be supported by your increasing knowledge of programming.

The key is to demonstrate your ability to make connections between the very specific, technical knowledge you're picking up about JavaScript, the DOM, p5.js and other libraries with your understanding of creative work in computation arts more general. What can you do now that you couldn't before, and where will you go next?

If you're not a huge fan of writing, consider simply writing the essay equally divided between the three general areas above. If you are a huge fan of writing, please try not to exceed the maximum word count by more than 20%.

## Submission
