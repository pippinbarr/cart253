# Pre-reflection

## Grade

Worth 10% of final grade.

## Deadlines

**Due by 23:59 on the night of your Variables class, week of 16 September 2024** (Two weeks)

If there is a serious need for an extension, contact your instructor at least 3 days *before* the final deadline.

## Brief

Write a focused, 500-1000 word essay that explores your present and potential future relationship to programming as a creative form of expression. The essay should:

* Discuss aspects of your existing programming experience (if any) that you find exciting in connection with creative expression. This can include elements that you are comfortable with, but also things you're challenged by but want to incorporate into your creative coding practice.
* Present one or more examples of creative code/software you are particularly inspired by and why. Note that the inspiration here should be drawn from the programming aspects rather than narrative, audiovisual aesthetics, game design, etc.
* Describe one or more big ideas you're interesting in exploring through creative programming with some initial thoughts on what you'll need to focus on to make them happen; make connections to the course outline and schedule to link these ideas to the course itself.

If you're not a huge fan of writing, consider simply writing the essay equally divided between the three general areas above. If you are a huge fan of writing, please try not to exceed the maximum word count by more than 20%.

## Submission

Save your essay as a PDF and include it in your course respository in a subfolder named `pre-reflection` or something similarly clear. Submit either the file itself or a link to the file on the Moodle page for this assignment.
