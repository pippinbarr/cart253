# Minigame library
## Nicolas Morales-Sanabria

This project is a minigame library, the library allows the player to access different games through menus and also runs a main game that makes multiple games interact with each other. The minigames included consist of the exercices made throughout the semester. In addition, there is a new game (the main game) that incorporates multiple games to create a new story using screenshots of code. The project also explored the creation of a p5 library, (p5.commonGameFunctions) which is used to simplify the code for the games and reduce duplicate code.

My artistic vision for this project was to connect the exercises made throughout the semester to create a collection of minigames but more importantly to create a thought-provoking story/experience with them. On top of the library, I created a main game that connects the exercises through a story, its goal is to be thought-provoking, raising questions about relations of power in our society and individual freedom. In game, users must decipher screenshots of code to access and complete challenges in minigames to progress. However, the lines of code contain a message beyond simple machine instructions. Every level displays instructions and comments that represent both the machine and societal system. The combination of the code, contextualized with the minigame it unlocks and the music played (especially the lyrics), aims to instill contemplation about different aspects of our lives and how much control we have over them. I believe the technical aspect of this project is well-done, the controls through the menus and games are relatively simple, allowing the user to easily explore everything while having a pleasant experience. The artistic aspect is visible through the style of each game but particularly the main game, which combines audiovisuals and code to convey my ideas.
