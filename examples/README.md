## p5 Editor Collection

Take a look at Pippin's [Collections](https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/collections) on p5's editor website. There are numerous short examples of code in categories like *Generative Art*, *Interactions*, and more that might help you get somewhere interesting!

## Games

### Traffic Inferno

A terrifying traffic game in which you drive your pretty little cyan car around the dangerous non-streets of a black night and try not to collide with the flaming wrecks of others.

Control your car with the arrow keys. UP = accelerate. LEFT and RIGHT = turn.

Keep moving to increase your score, stop and it will decrease. Try to set a high score I guess?

[Run the program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/games/traffic-inferno/) | [Source Code](https://www.github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/games/traffic-inferno/) | [Download Source](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/games/traffic-inferno.zip)

## Structure

### OOP States

An example of representing your program's states using **Object-Oriented Programming** with **inheritance** and **polymorphism**. Reworks an earlier example of a simulation with a title, simulation, and ending. Probably the ideal way to represent your states.

[Running program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/structure/oop-states/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/structure/oop-states) / [Download](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/structure/oop-states.zip)

## Time

### OOP and timers

An example of using `setTimeout()` in the context of a class definition specifically. Sadly, it doesn't "just work" the way you would expect because when `setTimeout()` calls a function it changes the meaning of `this` in that function. This example shows how to avoid this with the `bind()` method.

[Running program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/time/oop-and-timers/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/time/oop-and-timers) / [Download](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/time/oop-and-timers.zip)

## Graphics

### Clown chase

An example of combining **images** with **JavaScript Objects**. Two objects represented as different clown face images. The user controls one with the keyboard and the other one chases the user.

[Running program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/graphics/clown-chase/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/graphics/clown-chase) / [Download](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/graphics/clown-chase.zip)

### Clown chase with Object Oriented Programming

An example of combining **images** with **Object-Oriented Programming**. Two objects represented as different clown face images. The user controls one with the keyboard and the other one chases the user.

[Running program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/graphics/clown-chase-oop/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/graphics/clown-chase-oop) / [Download](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/graphics/clown-chase-oop.zip)

### Clown chase with inheritance

An example of combining **images** with **Object-Oriented Programming and inheritance**. Two objects represented as different clown face images. The user controls one with the keyboard and the other one chases the user.

[Running program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/graphics/clown-chase-inheritance/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/graphics/clown-chase-inheritance) / [Download](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/graphics/clown-chase-inheritance.zip)

## Text

### Typewriter effect

A class that mimics a typewriter for displaying a specified text. With a simple example script showing a basic usage. Could be more complicated, but just tries to show the basic idea.

[Running program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/text/typewriter-effect/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/text/typewriter-effect) / [Download](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/text/typewriter-effect.zip)

### Magic Word

A small example of requiring the user to using typing in a specific word as a form of input. It lets the user type characters and displays them, and compares their typed input to a magic word that solves the incredibly smart riddle.

[Running program](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/text/magic-word/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2020/tree/master/examples/text/magic-word) / [Download](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc/1/examples/text/magic-word.zip)
