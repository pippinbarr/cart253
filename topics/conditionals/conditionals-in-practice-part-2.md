## Our creature is back

Currently our creature responds in different ways to the mouse and keys, but we can be a bit more sophisticated now with logic operators. So let's delete the stuff in its `checkInput()` and change it up.

## Massage!

Let's change what makes the creature happy: massage.

How could we think of massage in the context of the mouse? What if we consider it massage if *two* things are true:

- The cursor is overlapping the creature AND
- The cursor is moving

So we want to be able to write something like:

```javascript
if (mouseIsOverlapping && mouseIsMoving) {
  // The cursor is overlapping the creature AND it's moving
  // So the creature is happy!
  creature.fill = creature.fills.happy;
}
```

These would be our two conditions. But for that to work we need the variables `mouseIsOverlapping` and `mouseIsMoving` to have the right `true` or `false` values in them.... so something like:

```javascript
const mouseIsOverlapping = ?;
const mouseIsMoving = ?;
if (mouseIsOverlapping && mouseIsMoving) {
  // The cursor is overlapping the creature AND it's moving
  // So the creature is happy!
  creature.fill = creature.fills.happy;
}
```

(We might as well use `const` here because we're not going to change these variables later.)

### `mouseIsOverlapping`

So, how do we write a condition that checks if the mouse cursor overlaps a circle (the creature)?

To check if a pair of (x,y) coordinates are inside a circle we can rely on a neat trick:

*The coordinates (x,y) are inside a specific circle if their *distance* from the centre of the circle* is *less than its radius*. As in this wonderful diagram:

![Diagram of how the distance from the centre of a circle tells us whether a point is inside or outside a circle](./images/distance-and-circles.png)

Better yet, there is a *function* in p5 called `dist()` that we can use to get the distance in pixels between two (x,y) coordinates! 

ðŸ“– Read the [`dist()`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/dist/) documentation. ðŸ“–

With that we can actually express our condition in math! Like this!

```javascript
// Calculate the distance between the cursor and the creature
// and put it into a "distance" variable (using const again since
// we won't change this again later!)
const distance = dist(mouseX, mouseY, creature.x, creature.y);
// Calculate whether the mouse overlaps the creature by checking whether
// the distance is less than its radius! (Half its diameter)
const mouseIsOverlapping = (distance < creature.size/2);
```

When we do this `mouseIsOverlapping` will be `true` is the mouse is inside the creature's circle, and `false` if it isn't!

### `mouseIsMoving`

How can we tell if the mouse is moving? Fortunately p5 gives us two variables that help us out here: `movedX` and `movedY` store how many pixels the mouse moved since the last frame on the x- and y-axes respectively. 

ðŸ“– Read the [`movedX`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/movedX/) and [`movedY`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/movedY/) documentation. ðŸ“–

So, if *either* of those variables are *not* `0` then the mouse moved right?

And that is maths, so we can write the code!

```javascript
// Check if EITHER movedX OR movedY are NOT equal to zero
// and store the result in our mouseIsMoving variable (another
// const because we don't want to change it later)
const mouseIsMoving = (movedX !== 0 || movedY !== 0);
```

That gives us both of our conditions, so we can finally check for massage

### Massage is go

We can replace our creature's `checkInput()` with our new idea!

```javascript
/**
 * Creature is happy if being massaged and otherwise bored
 */
function checkInput() {
    // Calculate the distance between the cursor and the creature
    // and put it into a "distance" variable (using const again since
    // we won't change this again later!)
    const distance = dist(mouseX, mouseY, creature.x, creature.y);
    // Calculate whether the mouse overlaps the creature by checking whether
    // the distance is less than its radius! (Half its diameter)
    const mouseIsOverlapping = (distance < creature.size/2);
    // Check if EITHER movedX OR movedY are NOT equal to zero
    // and store the result in our mouseIsMoving variable (another
    // const because we don't want to change it later)
    const mouseIsMoving = (movedX !== 0 || movedY !== 0);
    // Check if the mouse if over the creature and moving
    if (mouseIsOverlapping && mouseIsMoving) {
        // The cursor is overlapping the creature AND it's moving
        // So the creature is happy! Massage!
        creature.fill = creature.fills.happy;
    }
    else {
        // Otherwise the creature is bored
        creature.fill = creature.fills.bored;
    }
}
```

Phew! Now we have a creature that's happy if we're giving it a little mouse massage, and otherwise it's just SO BORED.

It's feeling more and more like a real thing.

1. Commit and push the changes you have made in this session with an appropriate commit message

## Summary

Most of the time when we're thinking about situations we care about, we care about *combinations* of events and ideas. Logic operators help us to *combine conditions* and so they allow us to express more complex (and naturalistic!) ideas about the world of our program.

  // Possible fills for the creature that show its mood
  // We'll need these when we start changing its colour
