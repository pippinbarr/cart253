# Conditionals {

âœ¨ Conditionals are the key way we can make a program do *different things* based on the current situation! âœ¨

## Learning objectives

- Understanding what "conditions" are in a program and how to write them out with `if`-statements

## Extra! Extra!

- *Images*
    - Read the [Loading and displaying images notes](../extras/images.md)
    - ðŸ“– You can also read the documentation for [`loadImage()`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/loadImage/) and [`image()`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/image/) ðŸ“–

## Challenges

- Try the [conditionals challenges](MISSING_LINK) (We will review them in class)

## Examples

## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: Text

We can store *text* in variables (or object properties) by using quotation marks:

```javascript
let myName = "Gladiolus";
```

We can *display* text by using p5's `text()` function along with some text-styling functions:

```javascript
let myName = "Gladiolus";

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(0);
    
    push();
    // Set text colour with fill
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    // Set text size with textSize()
    textSize(64);
    // Set text align with textAlign()
    textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
    // Set text styling with textStyle()
    textStyle(BOLD);
    // We can display text by just putting it directly in quotes
    text("Hi, my name is:", 200, 180);
    // We can display text inside a variable
    text(myName, 200, 220)
    pop();
}
```
