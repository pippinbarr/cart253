## Modules

As you can see, leaning heavily to video only here? Or is it smart to also spell it out? Depends on whether I want the example to be highly controlled or more realistic... maybe controlled is good though...

Maybe the texts should be *incredibly restricted*? Just the key take-away ideas, and you look at the video for the actual full experience...

Could even make some of these kind of post-hoc in terms of listing out what I actually do in the videos... though I should still plan out what I'm gonna do...

- √ States (needs text) <- small
- √ `switch` (states again) (needs text) <- small
- Having ideas (needs text)
    - Play based
    - Timer based
    - Example based
    - Function/technical idea based
    - Variation based
    - Things to avoid (for now): giant "what if" ideas completely divorced from programming
    - Asking for help
    - By the end I pick an idea <- simple but complex enough
- Breaking it down (video only?)
    - Breaking it down into the key concepts
    - Asking for help 
    - Can commit this too (README or just in top comment?)
- Pseudocode (video only?)
    - Writing almost code
    - Asking for help
    - Thinking of the functions
    - Can commit this too
- Assets (video only?)
    - Keep this mighty fucking simple
    - Don't obsess over the graphics
- Implementation and debugging (video only?)
    - Actually implementing it with code
    - Asking for help
    - Translating the pseudocode into real code
    - Constantly switching, constantly committing
- Release (video only?)
    - Making sure it works on Pages
    - Sending it to someone/posting it to the Discord
