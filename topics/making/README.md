# 🛠 Making {

✨ Actually *making our work* isn't just about knowing the syntax and commands of JavaScript and p5, it's about *coming up with ideas* that we can actually work on and be excited about! ✨

## Learning objectives

- Overcoming the terror of having to have an idea for a program
- Building from an idea through to a thorough plan through to pseudocode
- Understanding the connections (and fun!) from idea all the way to implementation

## 🔥 Hot tip: Assets are less important than code

You know how easy it is to get obsessed with making the *perfect* image or the most *delectable* sound? That burning desire to spend a rainy afternoon drawing and redrawing the main character from your game?

Try to avoid that unless you have the time to spare. In this course, at least, the *most important thing is your code*. You're better off having a great program that looks like a bunch of circles than a really basic program that has amazing graphics.
