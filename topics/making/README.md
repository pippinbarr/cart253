## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: Assets are less important than code

You know how easy it is to get obsessed with making the *perfect* image or the most *delectable* sound? That burning desire to spend a rainy afternoon drawing and redrawing the main character from your game?

Try to avoid that unless you have the time to spare. In this course, at least, the *most important thing is your code*. You're better off having a great program that looks like a bunch of circles than a really basic program that has amazing graphics.
