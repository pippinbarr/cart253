# Having ideas {
   
Learning how to program is one thing, learning to have *ideas* for what to make is another. Let's look at some ways to come up with ideas.

## What is a good idea?

A good idea is something that

1. You can confidently imagine how to execute (*with help* of course) (e.g. it has to be *doable*)
2. You can stay interested in for the duration of the project (e.g. there is nothing worse than being bored by your own idea)
3. Isn't just an example of a *genre* (e.g. "I'll just make a platformer")
4. Reflects *your personal sensibility* (e.g. it could only have been made by *you* - are you funny? deep? weird? It should be in there)
5. Is *simple* (e.g. don't make it complicated, make it clear)

So, you can just sit down and *have ideas*, but sometimes it helps to have a specific technique. Here are a few... ideas...

## Using a timer

Set a timer for 10 minutes and generate 50 ideas. That's one idea every 12 seconds. This will importantly give you *no time to second guess yourself*. Just throw down ideas as fast as possible and don't worry about their quality. It's all about *quantity*.

Use something like this [interval timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/interval-timer/) to set up a 12 second (or other length) interval and run it until you have your 50 (or other number of) ideas. Using the "clapping" sound effect is recommended for maximum self-esteem!

When you're done, revisit the ideas and figure out which ones appeal to you. Develop them further.

## Starting with an example

Is there an example from the course (or elsewhere) that resonates with you? Could you make it the *starting point* of your own process? Sometimes this can combine well with other approaches because it gives you some *constraints* on what kind of thing you're going to be making.

## Starting with a prompt

If your brain is really feeling dry and uninspired, consider getting a prompt of some kind that you can *react to*. There are lots of examples of you could use, such as:

- Load a [random wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) and try to imagine how you could make a simple interactive experience that reflects it somehow
- Roll some [story dice](https://davebirss.com/storydice/) and think about what kind of program could incorporate them all
- Use a [game idea generator](https://letsmakeagame.net/game-idea-generator/) to give you constraints like settings and "mechanics" (though remember to keep it simple)
- Stare confusedly an one of the [Oblique Strategies](https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html) by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt

## Making variations

One generative way to create an interesting project is to take a pre-existing experience and to make *variations* on that original. That way you get the constraints of an entire experience and can focus on novel ways of making it different. Pippin is obsessed with this:

## Asking for help

Tried all that and still stuck? Talk to someone else! Classmates, the TA, the instructor, your cat! Ask for help.

## Summary

When you're having ideas you need *quantity* and *then* quality. Try to let yourself feel free to have *any* idea and then worry about it later.
