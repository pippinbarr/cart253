This will be a little different - no coding required, but some design and implementation thinking instead!
    
## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Adding a score (design)

Think about how you would include a visible score that would increase each time you eat a fly successfully in the game. Will it be a number? A colour? Something that changes size?

### Challenge 1: Adding a score (planning)

Plan out how you would add your score to Frogfrogfrog. Think through the different aspects of the program you would need to change.

### Challenge 2: Adding a score (pseudocode)

Proceed all the way to pseudocode (starting with the pseudocode we saw in the modules) and add your changes in.

### Challenge 3: Adding a score (implementation)

Implement your score into the game and make it work!

### Challenge 4: Come up with five new features for Frogfrogfrog

Use brainstorming techniques as needed. Try to focus on keeping within a realistic scope, something you could actually do. Experiment with one or two really easy ideas and some more ambitious ones.

Try to have *way more than five ideas* and then edit down to the five ideas you like the most.

### Challenge 5: Debugging

Here's a broken version of Frogfrogfrog. See if you can debug it!
