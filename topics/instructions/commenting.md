# Basic commenting {

Programs are complicated animals and it can really help if we add *explanations* of how they work alongside the code itself. This process is called *commenting* our code and here we're going to look at *three* kinds of comments we should be including when we write a program.

## In this module

- Preparation
- Reading a program
- The top-level comment
- Function definition-level comments
- Instruction-level comments

## Preparation

If it's not already open, re-open your program from the *Function calls* unit in VS Code.

## Reading a program

One of the big things we have to be able to do when we're programming is *read our programs*. We also end up needing to *read other people's programs*. And that means that, inevitably, somebody else, who is not us, will also need to *read our program*.

Make a program *readable* or *legible* is a really important job for a programmer and one that is perilously easy to forget or to skip over. We will not be like that!

### Our program right now

So, we're working with this program (your version in the template might look a bit different, but this is the essence of the information we are working with):

```javascript
"use strict";

function setup() {
 createCanvas(640, 480);
}

function draw() {
    background(255, 100, 100);
    rect(200, 80, 240, 320);
}
```

### Good enough?

This program is small enough that right now we could *probably* read it without any help, but there's a bunch of stuff that is hard to understand just from the code. Things like:

- What is this program actually *for* or *about*?
- Is there any reason the canvas is set to be 640x480?
- What colour is that in the `background` function?
- What does that `rect` actually look like?
- What is the `draw` function trying to accomplish?

We can guess. We can run the program. We can painstakingly figure out the RGB values.

But it would be better if there were words that *told us* what is going on.

In programming, those kinds of explanatory words are called *comments*, and we need to put some in.

## The top-level comment

Any program should have a comment at the top of its main file (`script.js` for us) that introduces it clearly. There are no hard rules for this, but it's a good idea to provide

- The title (if you don't have a title, do you really know what you're doing?)
- The author (you!)
- An explanation of what the program does and how it does it
- Credit given to any external (not by you) code involved in the project

We can write stuff one inside `/**` and `*/` to turn it into a *comment* that JavaScript won't try to treat like it's part of the program. So we might write something like:

```javascript
/**
 * The Blank Page
 * Pippin Barr
 * 
 * An exploration of the existential angst of a novelist confronting
 * the blank page while under huge pressure from their publisher. The
 * program is non-interactive intentionally in order to simulate the
 * writer's inability to get started on the project.
 * 
 * Uses:
 * p5.js
 * https://p5js.org/
 */

"use strict";

function setup() {
    createCanvas(640, 480);
}

function draw() {
    background(255, 100, 100);
    rect(200, 80, 240, 320);
}
```

Now someone encountering our program will have a solid overview of what it's all about and how it works as well as who we are and what external code our program includes.

**Rule:** *Every program should have a top-level comment that explains it.*

## Function definition-level comments

It's best practice to write a similar kind of explanation, but more technically focused, for each individual *function definition* in the program. In our case that's `setup` and `draw`. So something like this:

```javascript
/**
 * The Blank Page
 * Pippin Barr
 * 
 * An exploration of the existential angst of a novelist confronting
 * the blank page while under huge pressure from their publisher. The
 * program is non-interactive intentionally in order to simulate the
 * writer's inability to get started on the project.
 * 
 * Uses:
 * p5.js and p5.sound
 * https://p5js.org/
 */

"use strict";

/**
 * Creates a 640x480 canvas for our masterpiece
 */
function setup() {
    createCanvas(640, 480);
}

/**
 * Draws a blank piece of paper on a pink background
 */
function draw() {
    background(255, 100, 100);
    rect(200, 80, 240, 320);
}
```

Now a reader would now the main objectives of our two key functions.

As you might imagine, our `setup` and `draw` and other function definitions will get *way more complicated* than this, but our comment will always just be a "summary" of what they do in plain language.

**Rule:** *Every function definition should have a comment.*

## Instruction-level comments

We can extend this idea of *explaining* all the way down to individual lines of code, or sometimes collections of lines. Specifically, if any line or lines aren't *totally easy* to read as they are, you should have a comment that helps give them some context.

For these kinds of comments we write our words after first writing `//`. So something like this:

```javascript
/**
 * The Blank Page
 * Pippin Barr
 * 
 * An exploration of the existential angst of a novelist confronting
 * the blank page while under huge pressure from their publisher. The
 * program is non-interactive intentionally in order to simulate the
 * writer's inability to get started on the project.
 * 
 * Uses:
 * p5.js and p5.sound
 * https://p5js.org/
 */

"use strict";

/**
 * Creates a 640x480 canvas for our masterpiece
 */
function setup() {
    // Create the canvas at a standard resolution
    createCanvas(640, 480);
}

/**
 * Draws a blank piece of paper on a pink background
 */
function draw() {
    // A pink background
    background(255, 100, 100);
    // The blank piece of paper
    rect(200, 80, 240, 320);
}
```

Now we have explanations at all levels of our program and pretty much *anyone* could read this now, programmer or not. Now the reader knows that the background is *pink*, that the rectangle represents a *piece of paper* and so on.

Good.

**Rule:** *Any time a comment would clarify how one or more lines of code work or what they are for, write the comme

## Finishing up

1. Commit and push the changes you have made in this session with an appropriate commit message

## Summary

We looked at three different kinds of comments we should be writing in our programs from now on:

1. *A top-level comment* should explain the broad strokes of the program, give it a title and author, and credit any other code you're using. Traditionally this goes inside `/** ... */` style comments
2. *Function definition-level comments* should explain what individual functions in your program do. Traditionally these also use the `/** ... */` style of comment
3. *Instruction-level comments* help to explain specific lines of code that may otherwise be hard to explain. Traditionally these use the `//` style of comment
