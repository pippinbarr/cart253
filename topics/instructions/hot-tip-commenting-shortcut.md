# Hot tip: Commenting Shortcut {
    
In VS Code if you select some of your code and then press:

- Mac: Comment-/
- Windows: Ctrl-/

It will toggle commenting for the selected code.


So if the code is not commented out, it will put `//` in front of each line and thus remove it from the program temporarily. 

Or, if the lines you select are already commented out, it will remove the commenting symbols and reinstate them.

This is super helpful for quickly bringing lines of code in and out of your running program without having to delete them!
