## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: Commenting Shortcut

In VS Code you can comment or uncomment the line of code at your text cursor using the shortcut
- Command-/ on macOS
- Control-/ on Windows

You can also comment or uncomment multiple lines by selecting them and using the same shortcut.

## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: Multiple Cursors

In VS Code you can position multiple cursors in order to delete or add text in many places at once. 
- macOS: click while holding **Option** to add a cursor
- Windows: click while holding **Control** to add a cursor

This also works if you hold the key and select text.
