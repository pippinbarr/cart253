# ðŸ’¿ Data {
    
âœ¨ Thinking and working with *data* in our programs is a key way to make them more manageable, more organized, and more exciting! It forces us to be more aware of *what's important* in our program, and to make sure we can express that information clearly. Your programs will thank you! âœ¨

## Learning objectives

- Understanding how to use data to simplify a program
- Understanding and using JSON data in a program

## Template

## Examples

- See the [Data Collection](https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/collections/nAnXQS1Ft) in Pippin's p5 editor for a series of Visual Novel-inspired examples, a localization example, better state data for states, and a data-mashup with JSON.

## Challenges

## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: Darius Kazemi's Corpora

If you're looking for fun data to play around with, a great option is Darius Kazemi's `corpora` repository: [https://github.com/dariusk/corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora)

In it you'll find a ton of quite manageable (not too massive or too complex) JSON files with data about all kinds of stuff. Animals! Art! Plants! Transportation!

You want data about every "house" in *Game of Thrones* for some reason??? [No problem](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/film-tv/game-of-thrones-houses.json)! The first 1000 prime numbers??? [Darius has you covered](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/mathematics/primes.json).
