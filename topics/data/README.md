## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: Darius Kazemi's Corpora

If you're looking for fun data to play around with, a great option is Darius Kazemi's `corpora` repository: [https://github.com/dariusk/corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora)

In it you'll find a ton of quite manageable (not too massive or too complex) JSON files with data about all kinds of stuff. Animals! Art! Plants! Transportation!

You want data about every "house" in *Game of Thrones* for some reason??? [No problem](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/film-tv/game-of-thrones-houses.json)! The first 1000 prime numbers??? [Darius has you covered](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/mathematics/primes.json).
