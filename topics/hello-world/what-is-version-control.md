## What is version control?

Version control is a way for us to track the entire *history* of a project over time. 

We work in a folder called a *repository* that stores all our project's files. Each time we make a significant *change* to our project, we *commit* that change to our project's *history* using version control.

We end up with a timeline of our project that marks every single time we made a change to it, as well as what the changes were.

For example, here's the version control repository (folder) for Pippin's project [*Let's Snake: Ancient Greek Punishment*](https://pippinbarr.com/lets-snake-ancient-greek-punishment/info/):

[https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-snake-ancient-greek-punishment/](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-snake-ancient-greek-punishment/)

And perhaps most importantly, here is the "commit history" of that project:

[https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-snake-ancient-greek-punishment/commits/master/](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-snake-ancient-greek-punishment/commits/main/)

You can see that each time the project was changed in a significant way, there is a timestamp, a message, and a record of exactly what was changed in it.

So you can see that on the 3rd of June, 2022 Pippin "[Fixed the weird event delay in ticks](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-snake-ancient-greek-punishment/commit/364291e2521c84cfad3d3fd2a1a0daed27228dd1)"!

## And why is it?

By using version control we can:

- *View the history of our project* laid out with timestamps and descriptions of the work done at each step
- *Revert* our project to a previous state if we made some huge mistake
- *Collaborate with others* on the same project far more easily
- *Easily work on our project on different systems* by just downloading the project repository where we need it
- *Meet industry standards for software development*, since pretty much any serious programming job will involve version control

In short, version control is pretty great and pretty important.
