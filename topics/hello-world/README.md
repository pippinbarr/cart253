## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: Some better user settings

By default VS Code can be a bit overaggressive with its autocomplete suggestions. If you'd like a relatively simple setup for your VS Code (assuming you haven't customized it a bunch already), then you could copy the following (including the curly brackets):

```json
{
    "security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles": "open",
    "workbench.startupEditor": "none",
    "liveServer.settings.donotShowInfoMsg": true,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.formatOnType": true,
    "[json]": {
        "editor.quickSuggestions": {
            "other": "off",
            "strings": "off"
        },
        "editor.inlineSuggest.suppressSuggestions": true,
        "editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": false
    },
    "editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter": false,
    "editor.trimAutoWhitespace": false,
    "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
    "update.showReleaseNotes": false,
    "javascript.suggest.enabled": false,
    "typescript.suggest.enabled": false
}
```

Then go to VS Code and:

1. Hit Command-Shift-P (Mac) or Control-Shift-P (Windows to open the "Command Palette)
2. Type "User Settings" to bring up the user settings option
3. Choose "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)
4. Select everything in the resulting file and replace it by pasting in the above JSON

Or, if you have a bunch of settings in there, feel free to add the stuff above at the end.

## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: One repository per project

Out in the "real world" developers start a repository for *each project* they work on. 

So if you were going to make a project for this class called *Eggmageddon* you'd go through the same steps you used to create your `cart253` repository, but instead create an `eggmageddon` repository.

Then, if you were starting a new project called *Judge, Jury and Eggsecutioner* you would create *another* repository called `judge-jury-and-eggsecutioner` to keep that one in. 

And so on and so on for *Eggscommunicated By the Pope*, *Egg You Very Much*, and *Sunny Side Up*.
