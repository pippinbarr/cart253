## ðŸ”¥ Hot tip: One repository per project

Out in the "real world" developers start a repository for *each project* they work on. 

So if you were going to make a project for this class called *Eggmageddon* you'd go through the same steps you used to create your `cart253` repository, but instead create an `eggmageddon` repository.

Then, if you were starting a new project called *Judge, Jury and Eggsecutioner* you would create *another* repository called `judge-jury-and-eggsecutioner` to keep that one in. 

And so on and so on for *Eggscommunicated By the Pope*, *Egg You Very Much*, and *Sunny Side Up*.
