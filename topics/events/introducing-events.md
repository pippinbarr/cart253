# Introducing events {
   
Our programs can respond to specific events - like mouse clicks, key presses, internet shutdowns, and more - by calling specific functions called *event handlers*. This is exciting because it greatly increases the ways our programs can be *responsive*.

## In this module

- Preparation
- What is an event?
- Responding to an event with an event handler
- `draw()` is an event handler
- `mousePressed()` is an event handler
- There are so many events!

## Preparation

1. Download the [template project](../../templates/template-p5-project.zip)
2. Unzip it
3. Rename the folder to `introducing-events`
4. Move the folder into your repository
5. Open the folder in VS Code
6. Give the program a title in `index.html` (maybe "Introducing events")
7. Commit and push the changes

## What is an event?

In programming, an event is essentially any kind of thing that can *happen at a specific moment in time* during your program and that your program can *be notified about*.

The user clicking down the mouse button is an event. If, while your program is running, the user clicks the mouse, it's possible to have your program be *told* that the user clicked the mouse.

Likewise, the user pressing a key on the keyboard is an event.

So is moving the mouse.

So is a timer finishing.

So is the internet connection being disabled.

These are all things that happen at a moment in time.

## Responding to an event with an event handler

We often want our programs to *respond* to specific events like mouse clicks and keypresses and timers because these can make them far more interesting to interact with.

In the big picture, the way we respond to events in a program is by *defining a function* that should be *called* when the event happens. This kind of function is called an *event handler*.

We'll see later on how we can take a lot more control of this process, but for now, let us be thankful that p5 already defines some of this for us.

Specifically, p5 will automatically call certain functions (event handlers) when certain specific events happen.

## `draw()` is an event handler

In fact, the `draw()` function we always define in our p5 programs *is* a function that responds to an event! It's an *event handler*.

ðŸ“– Read the [`draw()`] documentation ðŸ“–

What event does it respond to? The "next animation frame is ready" event! There is a timer hidden from us that is counting out the precise amount of time per frame (around 0.0167 seconds for a 60FPS program) and then *calling* `draw()` each time it elapses!

So when we define `draw()` we're defining the *event handler* for the "next animation frame is ready" event. It's the function that will be in charge of responding to that event.

And what does it do? It generally draws and animates and updates all the stuff that should happen for that specific frame. It's the core sense of *continuous time* in our program.

## `mousePressed()` is an event handler

We mentioned earlier that the user pressing the mouse button down is an event, and p5 will automatically call a function called `mousePressed()` each time that happens. 

ðŸ“– Read the [`mousePressed()`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mousePressed/) documentation ðŸ“–

So if we *define* a `mousePressed()` function in our program, p5 will *call* it every time the mouse is pressed, and thus our program can *respond to that event*:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  // Filling the background here so it DOESN'T
  // happen every frame
  background(0);
}

function draw() {
  // This is empty!
  // All the action happens when the mouse is pressed
  // By not refilling the background every frame we can see
  // the cumulative effect of the mouse presses!
}

/**
 * The mousePressed() function is AUTOMATICALLY CALLED BY p5
 * whenever the mouse button is pressed down! Handy!
 */
function mousePressed() {
  // Draw an ellipse on the canvas when the mouse is pressed down
  push();
  noStroke();
  fill(255, 255, 0);
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50);
  pop();
}
```

## There are so many events!

We won't have time to get into all of it, but it's possible for our programs to respond to a huge number of events, including:

- Mouse clicks, drags, presses, scrolls
- Keyboard presses, releases
- Animation frames
- File loading progress and completion
- CSS transitions
- HTML drag and drop
- Gaining and losing focus
- Switching in and out of fullscreen
- Screen touches
- Network connectivity changes
- Speech recognition and generation
- And more

It's a very exciting part of programming!

## Finishing up

1. Commit and push the changes you have made in this session with an appropriate commit message

## Summary

An *event* is something that happens at a *specific moment in time* that our program can be notified of. Specifically, we can define a function called an *event handler* that will be called when the event happens. The power is ours!
