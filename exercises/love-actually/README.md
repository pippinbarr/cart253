4. Open the `love-actually` folder in Atom
5. Commit and push in GitHub Desktop with a message saying "Ex: Started Love, Actually exercise"

## Brief

Change the "looking for love" simulation activity. Ideally, you could think of how you want to change the meaning/nature of the simulation (maybe it could be about unrequited love? Or about unwanted love? Or platonic love? Or being a fan of a YouTuber? Or something else?). Make it **your** simulation of love (or, if you like, change it to be about something completely different!).

Make your changes to the simulation with the following requirements:

1. **Allow the user to control one of the circles**
  - Anything goes, from clicking to position it, to having it follow the mouse, to using the arrow keys, to something else
2. **Make the non-user circle move differently**
  - Use random movement or Perlin noise or teleportation or something else!
3. **Add at least one extra function**
  - Not including functions any built-in p5 functions like `keyPressed()`
  - Maybe you could add a function that checks if one circle has grown too large (if they grow) or shrunk too small (if they shrink), or faded too much (if their alpha fades)
4. **Add at least one extra ending**
  - Maybe it could be an "easter egg" and hard to discover? (Moving the mouse to a really specific location?)
  - Maybe it offers a different dimension of thinking about love and loss?
  - Maybe it's connected to the new function in the previous step?

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cc1/tree/master/exercises/love-actually/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc1/exercises/love-actually/)
