# Exercise: Project Progress Report {

#### Grade
- 4% of final grade
- Remember that only 5 of your completed and passing exercises contribute to the final grade
- Further guidelines below

#### Deadline
- Section A (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 18 November 2021.
- Section B (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 16 November 2021.

## Objectives

1. Progressing the final project
2. Reflecting on your progress and planning for future work

## Technical detail

Continue to work on your project in its own project folder as normal, but when submitting this exercise **copy a working version of the project folder** into your `exercises` folder and rename it to `project-progress-report`.

The outcome should be that the evaluator can view your current working project in the `project-progress-report` folder of your repository.

**Do not** submit your main project folder as this could lead to problems if you make changes between submission and grading.

## Brief

The objective of this exercise is to serve as a milestone for your final project design and development. As such, the exercise requires that you make progress on the project itself (notably that it be clearly advanced from your submitted **prototype**) and that you reflect in writing on the nature of your progress and the next steps to be taken.

You will submit:
1. **Project** - this will be a working version of your project (without errors) that shows the progress you have made since your prototype submission. As with past prototypes, grades will not consider style so long as the code is readable enough to determine progress.
2. **Reflection** - this will be a PDF in the same folder as your exercise submission that presents a written reflection of at least 250 words (using visual aids as necessary) covering:
  1. The **progress** you have made since the proposal/prototype stage. You should explicitly note what has been added since the prototype as well as the design and technical challenges faced along the way to this point.
  2. Your plans for **future work** in terms of design and technical challenges yet to come.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cc1/tree/master/exercises/project-progress-report/) (this will include the reflection PDF in the folder)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc1/exercises/project-progress-report/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Code is **readable**
- Project has made significant progress since **prototype and proposal stage**
- Reflection document shows clear thoughtfulness about the current state of the project as well as next steps in terms of design and technical elements
