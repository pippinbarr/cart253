# Course Software

Here are instructions for getting your system ready to follow along with the core tools we use in the course.

## A browser

We use a __web browser__ to run our programs in this course. Any web browser is fine so long as you are able to enable the "developer tools". If you're unsure, just use __Chrome__ or __Firefox__. You probably already have one or both of these installed, but if not, here are the links to install them:

- Chrome can be downloaded at <https://www.google.com/chrome/>
- Firefox can be downloaded at <https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/>

## VS Code

We use __VS Code__ as our text editor. It's a nice, free text editor that's very popular among developers. To get it:

1. Go to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
1. Download VS Code to your computer
1. Install it by following its instructions

If you prefer some other text editor, by all means use it, just make sure it supports your work.

**NOTE:** We used to use Atom and much of the course video materials show Pippin using Atom. Don't worry, VS Code is *very* similar and any differences will be explained.

## Extensions

One of the great things about __VS Code__ (and most development-oriented text editors) is that it provides great base functionality but also a huge range of *extensions* that you can use to add specific functionality you want. Feel free to browse the range of extensions available by going to the "extensions" section of the program - notably via the symbol of three squares (one offset) on the left hand side of the editor.

Arguably the most important extension for you to install right away is the *Live Server* extension. This will add a "Go Live" button at the bottom right of your editor allowing you to see your code running in a browser. To install it:

1. Click on the "extensions" icon on the left hand side of VS Code
1. Search for "Live Server" (it's the one with almost 39 million downloads!)
1. Click on the "Install" button for the "Live Server" extension

## GitHub Desktop

We will be using __version control__ as a central part of this course. To make our lives easier we're going to use __GitHub Desktop__ so we have a nice user-interface to version control.

1. Go to <https://desktop.github.com/>
1. Use the link to download GitHub Desktop to your computer
1. Install it

For now, __don't run GitHub Desktop__ as you won't have created your course repository, which is what we will use it for.

**NOTE:** You can also do all your version control inside VS Code if you'd like to. There are instructions for this, and your instructor can give you pointers if you want to go that route.

## Zoom

We will most likely use __Zoom__ as a way to screen record Q&A sessions in class. It is the dominant videoconferencing software at the moment and the one used by the university. Notably, if you need to videoconference in to a class for some reason, you would use Zoom and Discord (see below). To obtain it:

1. Go to <https://zoom.us/download> and follow the download instructions

To use Zoom you will usually simply be emailed a link that looks something like

<https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/1234567890>

When you click the link your browser will try to open Zoom and connect to the videoconference. If something goes funny, you can also join a meeting by running Zoom yourself and entering the "Meeting ID", which is the 10-digital number at the end of the link above.

## Discord

We will mostly use __Discord__ to communicate outside of the classroom. Discord is a fairly standard instant messaging, voice- and video-chat, and screen sharing application. To use Zoom it is best to have the application on your computer. You'll also need an account.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/register> and follow the instructions to register for a Discord account
1. Go to <https://discord.com/new> to download the Discord application for your computer
1. Run Discord and log in

You will be emailed a link to join the course Discord. Please don't share it with anyone outside the course.

## Summary

We now have the key software for this course.

1. We use a __browser__ (like Chrome or Firefox) to run our programs
1. We use __VS Code__ as a text editor to write out programs
1. We use __GitHub Desktop__ and __GitHub__ to store our work in a repository
1. We use __Zoom__ for live videoconferencing when needed
1. We use __Discord__ as our home base for communicating about the course
