* [p5 Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) - Examples of what p5 can do

## JavaScript

* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - A website devoted to learning to code, with excellent courses in JavaScript. A little dry, but very thorough.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Another website for learning to code, with good coverage of JavaScript. Again, not arts-oriented, but solid.
* [W3 Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) - Bare bones but solid tutorial from W3 schools
* [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps) - Beginner JavaScript from the Mozilla Foundation
* [Getting Started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) - Good introduction to the web and web programming more generally from the Mozilla Foundation
* [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) - The Mozilla Foundation again with a complete guide to the language (gets pretty advanced)
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke - A wonderful introduction to JavaScript, though it does get quite advanced quite quickly (might be good to read after this course)
