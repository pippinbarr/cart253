# 💬 Instructions

Week of 11 September 2023

## NOTE

**This is a reminder that there are a couple of small differences between the programming environment you'll see in the instructional videos and what we're using this year:**

* **Our code editor is *VS Code* and not *Atom***
* **Starting the program in the browser uses the *Go Live* button in VS Code and not *atom-live-server* in Atom**
* **Your repository is probably called `cart253-2023` and not `cc1`**
* **The main branch of your repository is called `main` and not `master`**

**If you notice anything else confusing please let Pippin know so he can add it to the list.**
