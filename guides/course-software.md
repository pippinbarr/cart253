# Course Software {

Here are instructions for getting your system ready to follow along with the core tools we use in the course.

## A browser

We use a **web browser** to run our programs in this course. Any web browser is fine so long as you are able to enable the "developer tools". If you're unsure, just use **Chrome** or **Firefox**. You probably already have one or both of these installed, but if not, here are the links to install them:

- Chrome can be downloaded at <https://www.google.com/chrome/>
- Firefox can be downloaded at <https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/>

## VS Code

We use **VS Code** as our text editor. It's a nice, free text editor that's very popular among developers. To get it:

1. Go to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
1. Download VS Code to your computer
1. Install it by following its instructions

If you prefer some other text editor, by all means use it, just make sure it supports your work.

### VS Code Settings

### VS Code Extensions

One of the great things about **VS Code** (and most development-oriented text editors) is that it provides great base functionality but also a huge range of *extensions* that you can use to add specific functionality you want. Feel free to browse the range of extensions available by going to the "extensions" section of the program - notably via the symbol of three squares (one offset) on the left hand side of the editor.

#### Go Live

Arguably the most important extension for you to install right away is the *Live Server* extension. This will add a "Go Live" button at the bottom right of your editor allowing you to see your code running in a browser. To install it:

1. Click on the "extensions" icon on the left hand side of VS Code
1. Search for "Live Server" (it's the one with almost 39 million downloads!)
1. Click on the "Install" button for the "Live Server" extension
1. Look for the "Go Live" button that should now have appeared at the bottom-right of your VS Code window

## GitHub Desktop

We will be using **version control** as a central part of this course. To make our lives easier we're going to use **GitHub Desktop** so we have a nice user-interface to version control.

1. Go to <https://desktop.github.com/>
1. Use the link to download GitHub Desktop to your computer
1. Install it

For now, **don't run GitHub Desktop** as you won't have created your course repository, which is what we will use it for.

**NOTE:** You can also do all your version control inside VS Code if you'd like to. It's a little more complex to set up, so ask your instructor or TA if you want help to do it.

## Zoom

We will most likely use **Zoom** in some capacity during the class such as for office hours. It is the videoconferencing software most used by the university. You probably already have it, but if not:

1. Go to <https://zoom.us/download> and follow the download instructions

To use Zoom you will usually simply be emailed a link. When you click the link your browser will try to open Zoom and connect to the videoconference.

## Discord

We will use **Discord** to communicate outside of the classroom. Discord is a fairly standard instant messaging, voice- and video-chat, and screen sharing application.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/register> and follow the instructions to register for a Discord account
1. Go to <https://discord.com/new> to download the Discord application for your computer
1. Run Discord and log in

An invitation link for the course Discord will be availabe on Moodle. Please don't share it with anyone outside the course.

## Summary

We now have the key software for this course.

1. We use a **browser** (like Chrome or Firefox) to run our programs
1. We use **VS Code** as a text editor to write out programs
1. We use **GitHub Desktop** to manage our code
1. We use **Zoom** for live videoconferencing when needed
1. We use **Discord** as our home base for communicating about the course
