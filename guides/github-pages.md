## Set up GitHub Pages

We use a tool called **GitHub Pages** on GitHub to be able to host our coursework on their servers, making it visible to anyone on the web if we wish. It's an amazing cheap web hosting option!

1. Go to <https://www.github.com/yourgithubusername/cart253-2023> (the homepage of your new course repository, substitute your GitHub username for `yourgithubusername` and if you called the repository something other than `cart253-2023` use that instead)
1. Click on "Settings" (the right-most option in the repository's menu)
1. Go to the menu item "Pages" in the left-hand menu bar
1. Under **Source** use the drop-down menu to select "Deploy from a branch"
1. Under **Branch** use the drop-down menu to select "main"
1. Click "Save"
