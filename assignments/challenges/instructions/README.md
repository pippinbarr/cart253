# Instructions Challenge

Let's make sure we understand the key ideas of writing *instructions* in JavaScript by using the drawing functions of p5 to do some drawing.

As with all challenges, do this work *in pairs*. This means you will both submit the same work and should work together on one computer to produce the project.

## Challenge

With your partner:

> Draw a landscape

This can be as complicated and gorgeous or weird as you like, but must include:

1. Some land (hills? mountains? lunar surface?)
2. Some sky (blue? grey? purple?)
3. One or more suns and/or moons
4. One or more flying creatures (bird? pterodactyl? toaster?)
5. One of more land-based creatures (cow? person? cow-person?)
6. One or more dwellings (house? tent? burrow?)

Ask for help from the instructor and teaching assistant as needed.

## Evaluation

When you're finished, check in with the instructor or teaching assistant to show them your work and they will confirm you've passed the challenge and can submit it on the Moodle.

This challenge is pass/fail and is worth 1% of your final grade.

## Submission

Once you're cleared to submit, go to the Moodle and both submit your work. You should each separately submit:

- Your names
    - The link to the repository on GitHub (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253)
    - The link to the website version on GitHub Pages (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253)
    
*Note*: It's fine if the project is only in one of your repositories, but it's not a bad idea to make sure you *both* have it for your own reference.
