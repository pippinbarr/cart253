# Making Challenge

Here's a chance to make some initial progress on the Mod Jam!

Unlike other challenges, do this work *solo*, though feel free to brainstorm with other people if you'd like to (you still have to submit your own list of ideas though).

## Challenge

> Come up with 20+ ideas for the Mod Jam

### Step 1: Create a text document to write your ideas down

If you don't already have an existing project folder for your [Mod Jam](../../mod-jam/) project in your course repository, start one with the [template project](../../../templates/template-p5-project.zip).

Create a folder called something like `process` and inside that create a file called something like `ideas.md` or `brainstorm.md`.

### Step 2: Have ideas

Without pressure on having *great* ideas, and with a focus on having *small* ideas, write at least *twenty* (20) ideas as a list for things you could add to the frogfrogfrog game as your Mod Jam project.

In markdown it might look something like this:

```md
# Mod Jam ideas

1. Frog is made of cheese
2. Frog moves on its own and player controls the fly
3. Frog is a vampire and has to hide from the sun
4. ... etc.
```

Note these are just examples and could be considered a bit more ambitious than necessary. Maybe they could be broken down into several parts, each one a separate modification of the original game.

### Step 3: Add some notes

Once you have your 20+ ideas written down, go back over them and add some brief notes to each idea with your initial thoughts on any first ideas you have for how to actually *do* the idea, including perceived challenges.

It might look something like this:

```md
# Mod Jam ideas

1. Frog is made of cheese (what does that even mean though? It's just yellow? It has holes in it? It kind of melts? Or stinks? The fly wants to eat it? This is a weird idea... needs more thought.)
2. Frog moves on its own and player controls the fly (would need a "frog AI" but could just have it bounce back and forth and randomly shoot its tongue? And then would have to design on fly control? Just the mouse?)
3. Frog is a vampire and has to hide from the sun (Why is the frog a vampire? Does it want to bite the flies? Do they become vampires? How to do a day night cycle? Where would the frog hide? Maybe a leaf? It could go under the water? Would need water...)
4. ... etc.
```

## Evaluation

When you have 20+ ideas and notes, you're done and you can submit on the Moodle.

This challenge is pass/fail and is worth 1% of your final grade.

## Submission

Once you're cleared to submit, go to the Moodle and submit your work. You should submit:

- Your name
    - The link to the repository on GitHub (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/topics/making/making-challenge/)
    - The link to the website version on GitHub Pages (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253/topics/making/making-challenge/)
