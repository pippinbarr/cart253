# Instructions Challenge

Let's make sure we understand the key ideas of writing *instructions* in JavaScript by using the drawing functions of p5 to do some drawing.

As with all challenges, do this work *in pairs*. This means you will both submit the same work and should work together on one computer to produce the project.

To start up you should:

1. Download the [template project](../../../templates/template-p5-project.zip)
2. Rename that folder, maybe to `instructions-challenge`
3. Put that folder in your `cart253` repository
4. Commit and push that change with a message like "Started the instructions challenge"
5. Keep committing and pushing as you go along to practice your commit message writing

## Challenge

With your partner(s):

> Draw a landscape

This can be as complicated and gorgeous or weird as you like, and could include:

1. Some land (hills? mountains? lunar surface?)
2. Some sky (blue? grey? purple?)
3. One or more suns and/or moons
4. One or more flying creatures (bird? pterodactyl? toaster?)
5. One of more land-based creatures (cow? person? cow-person?)
6. One or more dwellings (house? tent? burrow?)

Ask for help from the instructor and teaching assistant as needed.

## Evaluation

When you're finished, show the instructor or teaching assistant your work and they will confirm you've passed the challenge and can submit it on the Moodle.

This challenge is pass/fail and is worth 1% of your final grade.

## Submission

Once you're cleared to submit, go to the Moodle and both submit your work. You should **all separately submit**:

- Your names
    - The link to the repository on GitHub (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/topics/instructions/landscape-challenge/)
    - The link to the website version on GitHub Pages (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253/topics/instructions/landscape-challenge/)
    
*Note*: It's fine if the project is only in one of your repositories, but it's not a bad idea to make sure you *both* have it for your own reference.
