# Hello, World! Challenge

We need to make sure we feel comfortable with our software and especially the idea of *version control*.

As with all challenges, do this work *in pairs*. Help each other! Talk! Compare notes! Revel in the solidarity!

## Challenge

> Create your `cart253` repository and make multiple edits to and commits of `README.md`

1. Follow the [Hello, World Learning Materials](../../../topics/hello-world/) on version control as needed to each create your `cart253` repository on your own computer or on a lab computer. (Ideally, use the text-based materials rather than the video so you can easily talk to each other.)
2. Use your text editor to make changes to the `README.md` file, taking the opportunity to practice with markdown for formatting. Commit and push to the repository with a good commit message. 
3. Repeat step 2 multiple times to make the `README.md` file into a nice explanation of what will be in the repository.

Help and ask for help from your partner and from the instructor and teaching assistant as needed.

*Extra*: See if you can display an image in `README.md`.

## Evaluation

When you're finished, or have done everything you can do (with help), check in with the instructor or teaching assistant to show them your work and they will confirm you've passed the challenge and can submit it on the Moodle.

This challenge is pass/fail and is worth 1% of your final grade.

## Submission

Once you're cleared to submit, go to the Moodle and both submit your work. You should each separately submit:

- Your name
    - The link to your repository on GitHub (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253)
    - The link to the website version of your repository on GitHub Pages (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253)
- The name of your partner for this challenge
    - The link to *their* repository on GitHub
    - The link to *their* website version
