# 🤔 Pre-reflection {

## Grade

Worth 10% of final grade.

## Deadlines

- 🔥 Section B: 23:59, 17 September 2024
- 🔥 Section A: 23:59, 19 September 2024

That is, you have two weeks from assignment.

If there is a serious need for an extension, contact your instructor at least 3 days *before* the final deadline.

## Brief

Write a reflective essay that explores your present and future relationship to programming as a creative form. The essay must cover:

- Your **existing programming experience** (if any) and its connection to creative expression. If you have no programming experience, discuss your perception of programming as a creative form instead.
- **Three examples of creative programming** you are inspired by. These can be games, screen-based artworks, interactive websites, installation work, or anything else that involves programming. Your discussion should focus on the role of *programming specifically*.
- **A dream project** you would like to be able to create eventually through creative programming. Don't worry about it being feasible, but do focus on the role of programming.

Word count required: 750-1000 words.

Illustrations/sketches/screenshots are great but not required.

## Submission

Save your essay as a PDF and include it in your course respository in a subfolder named `pre-reflection` or something similarly clear. Submit either the file itself or a link to the file on the Moodle page for this assignment.
