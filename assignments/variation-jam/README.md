## Objectives

- Deploying the full set of programming skills covered in the course, including arrays, loops, and data-structures.
- Understanding how a basic underlying experience can be made distinctive through different programming approaches
- Creating a more polished work that could be part of a portfolio

## Brief

Start with an existing **very simple** experience - this can be either a fleshed out example from the course (including Frogsfrogsfrog if desired) or something you come up with yourself. Create a minimum of **three** (but ideally more) distinct variations on the experience (if you create your own experience from scratch, that will count as one of the three). 

Consider work like [PONGS](https://pippinbarr.com/pongs/info/), [SNAKISMS](https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISMS/info/), and [Chesses](https://pippinbarr.com/chesses/info/) to get a sense of what this could mean (though your underlying system may be simpler than these).

Feel free to borrow from any of the example code you've seen so far in the course, but make sure to **attribute** in your `README.md` and/or your `script.js`.

## Advice

1. **Start early**. Don't delay thinking about the project. Get your ideas together early so that you've got a good amount of time to work on them.
2. **Start small**. Think of the smallest possible version of what you want to make and make that first. Once it works, you can start adding to it.
3. **Seek help**. Ask for help early to discuss your idea and work out ways to achieve it, as well as to get specific technical help as you run into problems. If you can't think of an idea, ask for help with that.
4. **Be stylish**. Make sure you read the [style guide](../../guides/style-guide.md).

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **assignment** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. <https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/main/assignments/variation-jam/>)
2. A link to your project running online (e.g. <https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253-2023/assignments/variation-jam/>)

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that your project actually runs online before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that comment your project before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that you have written a `README.md` before you submit ðŸ”¥
