## Objectives

- Building strength with the basics of JavaScript, particularly variables, conditionals, and events
- Developing a sense of how a more complex program works and how to make changes to it systematically
- Finding surprising ways to change a conventional design through programming specifically

## Brief

Starting with the [Frogfrogfrog Project](../../topics/making/examples/frogfrogfrog.zip). Add a minimum of a further **five** (but ideally more) new features to the experience. Examples might include:

- A scoring system.
- New kinds of fly movement.
- Visually bringing the fly back to the frog's mouth on capture.
- A title, instructions, and ending screen.
- A new control system.
- Visual effects.

ðŸ”¥ If you desperately want to start from a different example, or from scratch, talk to the instructor as soon as possible. ðŸ”¥

Feel free to borrow from any of the example code you've seen so far in the course, but make sure to **attribute** in your `README.md` and/or your `script.js`.

## Advice

1. **Start early**. Don't delay thinking about the project. Get your ideas together early so that you've got a good amount of time to work on them.
2. **Start small**. Think of the smallest possible version of what you want to make and make that first. Once it works, you can start adding to it.
3. **Seek help**. Ask for help early to discuss your idea and work out ways to achieve it, as well as to get specific technical help as you run into problems. If you can't think of an idea, ask for help with that.
4. **Be stylish**. Make sure you read the [style guide](../../guides/style-guide.md).

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **assignment** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. <https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/main/assignments/mod-jam/>)
2. A link to your project running online (e.g. <https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253-2023/assignments/mod-jam/>)

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that your project actually runs online before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that comment your project before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that you have written a `README.md` before you submit ðŸ”¥
