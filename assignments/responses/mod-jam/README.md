## Objectives

- Developing critical thinking and reflective skills in response to other creative coding work

## Brief

During the Mod Jam Response time you will be assigned to look at the work of a small set of other students during studio time. Make sure to take notes and ask questions of your colleagues.

In your own time, write a roughly 500-word response to the work that you saw, especially noting down what you found most *surprising* and *compelling* in the work you experienced. You can focus on the code, the experience itself, or both, depending on what you find most interesting.

Your response should include *links* to each of the running programs you experienced. Make sure you get the working links.

Your response should be written in *markdown* as a file titled something like `mod-jam-response.md` in an appropriate folder in your class repository. This will make it easier to share with others.

## Advice

1. **Start early**. Don't delay thinking about the response. Get your ideas together early and just write the thing.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **assignment** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your reflection in the repository (e.g. <https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/main/assignments/mod-jam-response/mod-jam-response.md/>)

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that your links work before you submit ðŸ”¥

## Evaluation
