## Brief

Write a short essay that explores your past, present and potential future relationship to programming as a creative form. The essay should:

- **Revisit your programming knowledge at the start of the course** and compare it to what you know now. What are the most significant changes?
- **Discuss the relationship between your new programming knowledge and your  creative practice**. This can include elements that you are comfortable with, but also things you're challenged by but want to work on incorporating into your creative coding practice. What can you do now as an artist who codes?
- **Revisit the Big Idea you discussed in the pre-reflection**. Are you closer to accomplishing it now? How has your understanding of the project changed? If you've moved on, describe a new Big Idea that you're excited about working toward as a creative programmer.

In your discussions, it is key to demonstrate your ability to make connections between your specific, technical knowledge (p5.js, JavaScript, etc.) and your approach to creative work in computation arts.

Word count required: 1000-1250 words.

Illustrations/sketches/screenshots are great but not required.
