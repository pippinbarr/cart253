## Brief

Write a short essay that explores your relationship to programming as it has developed over this course. The essay should:

- **Revisit your programming knowledge at the start of the course** and compare it to what you know now. What are the most significant changes?
- **Discuss the relationship between your new programming knowledge and your creative practice**. This can include elements that you are comfortable with, but also things you're challenged by but want to work on incorporating into your creative coding practice. What can you do now as an artist who codes?
- **Look to the future of your role as a creative coder**. How much closer are you to owning that role? How has your understanding of creative code changed? What are you looking forward to being able to do in the future?

In your discussions, it is key to demonstrate your ability to make connections between your specific, technical knowledge (p5.js, JavaScript, if-statements, for-loops, etc. etc. etc.) and your approach to creative work in computation arts.

Word count required: 1000-1250 words.

Illustrations/sketches/screenshots are great but not required.
