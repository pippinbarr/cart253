## Objectives



## Brief


Some ideas might be:

- ...


Feel free to borrow from any of the code you've seen so far in the course, but make sure to attribute in your `README.md` and/or your `script.js`.

## Requirements

### At least two moving elements

Your simulation should include at least two "things", most obviously at least one thing the user controls, and one other thing. They should be represented as JavaScript objects in your code.

### Aesthetic, conceptual, and procedural harmony

The elements of your simulation should make sense together (even if you're doing something more avant-garde). That is, the way the program works (the code, the interactivity) and the way the program looks and sounds (the aesthetics) should support the core ideas of the simulation concept.

## Advice

1. **Start early**. Don't delay thinking about the project. Get your ideas together early so that you've got a good amount of time to work on them.
2. **Start small**. Think of the smallest possible version of what you want to make and make that first. Once it works, you can start adding to it.
3. **Seek help**. Ask for help early to discuss your idea and work out ways to achieve it, as well as to get specific technical help as you run into problems. If you can't think of an idea, ask for help with that.
4. **Be stylish**. Don't forget about the [style guide](../../guides/style-guide.md).

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **assignment** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. <https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/main/projects/project1/>)
2. A link to your project running online (e.g. <https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253-2023/projects/project1/>)

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that your project actually runs online before you submit ðŸ”¥

## Evaluation
