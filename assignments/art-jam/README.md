## Objectives

- Get comfortable with starting, coding, and distributing a simple JavaScript project
- Develop familiarity with the p5 library and its drawing functions and variables in particular
- Build confidence in understanding variables both in terms of how they work and how they can contribute to expressive work

## Brief

Using p5's drawing instructions and variables as well as your own variables, create a surprising and compelling visual experience on the canvas. This could be representational or abstract according to your preference. But it must:

- **Use variables** to create change of different kinds (movement, scale, colour, and more)
- **Use `mouseX` and `mouseY`** to allow for some user interaction/input
- **Use p5's `map()` function** in some capacity (learn about it by [reading the `map()` reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/map/))

Using conditionals is optional but encouraged.

Feel free to borrow from any of the example code you've seen so far in the course, but make sure to **attribute** in your `README.md` and/or your `script.js`.

## Advice

1. **Start early**. Don't delay thinking about the project. Get your ideas together early so that you've got a good amount of time to work on them.
2. **Start small**. Think of the smallest possible version of what you want to make and make that first. Once it works, you can start adding to it.
3. **Seek help**. Ask for help early to discuss your idea and work out ways to achieve it, as well as to get specific technical help as you run into problems. If you can't think of an idea, ask for help with that.
4. **Be stylish**. Make sure you read the [style guide](../../guides/style-guide.md).

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **assignment** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. <https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/main/assignments/art-jam/>)
2. A link to your project running online (e.g. <https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253-2023/assignments/art-jam/>)

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that your project actually runs online before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that comment your project before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that you have written a `README.md` before you submit ðŸ”¥
