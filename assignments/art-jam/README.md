## Objectives

- Get comfortable with starting, coding, and distributing a simple JavaScript project
- Develop familiarity with the p5 library and its drawing functions and variables in particular
- Build confidence in understanding variables both in terms of how they work and how they can contribute to expressive work

## Brief

> Draw a self-portrait (in JavaScript with p5)

Using p5's drawing instructions, create a self-portrait on the canvas. You have total freedom of representation here, so it could be realistic, abstract, absurd, dada, pointilist, expressionist, cubist, procedural, scary, etc.

The self-portrait must:

- **Use variables** to create change over time

- **Use `mouseX` and `mouseY`** to allow for some user interaction

- **Use at least one p5 function you've never tried** (search the reference, make sure you *state* the new function in your `README.md`)

- **Use at least one conditional** to make the program respond to a changing variable

Feel free to borrow from any of the example code you've seen so far in the course, but make sure to **attribute** in your `README.md`.

## How to start a project

Remember to take this basic steps to get going:

1. Download the [template project](../../templates/template-p5-project.zip)
2. Rename that folder, maybe to `art-jam`
3. Put that folder in your `cart253` repository somewhere
4. Commit and push that change with a message like "Started the art jam"
5. Keep committing and pushing as you go along to max out your commitment grade

## Advice

1. **Start early**. Don't delay thinking about the project. Get your ideas together early so that you've got a good amount of time to work on them.
2. **Start small**. Think of the smallest possible version of what you want to make and make that first. Once it works, you can start adding to it.
3. **Seek help**. Ask for help early to discuss your idea and work out ways to achieve it, as well as to get specific technical help as you run into problems. If you can't think of an idea, ask for help with that.
4. **Be stylish**. Make sure you read the [style guide](../../guides/style-guide.md).
5. **Be committed**. Remember your grade is heavily affected by your use of version control and writing good commit messages.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **assignment** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes:

1. A link to your exercise code in your repository (e.g. <https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/main/assignments/art-jam/>)
2. A link to your project running online (e.g. <https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253/assignments/art-jam/>)

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that your project actually runs online before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that you have commented your project before you submit ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Make sure that you have filled out your `README.md` before you submit ðŸ”¥
