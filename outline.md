## [Territorial acknowledgment](https://www.concordia.ca/about/indigenous/territorial-acknowledgement.html)

We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien‚Äôkeh√°:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohti√°:ke/Montreal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.

## Description

Learning to program is at the heart of understanding computation. In this course we cover an introduction to the key elements of programming, all while emphasizing experimental and playful approaches to software aesthetics. Students will spend time both learning the basics of how to program while also producing their own original work in a studio environment.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Read, understand and write JavaScript
* Comfortably use the arts-oriented library p5 to make digital art
* Use programming to explore and express their ideas

## Key activities

### Lectures

Most weeks will include a number of lecture videos and notes covering a specific topic in programming for students to follow in their own time before that week's class time.

### Challenges

Most weeks will include a small set of challenges for students to test their understanding of the week's material. The challenges will be discussed in class.

### Class structure

#### Discussion

Each class will being with a discussion period in the classroom. This will generally include:

- a chance for students to present and discuss their responses to the week's challenges
- an ongoing series of discussions of how a computer perceives and executes the code related to the week's topic
- a presentation of a useful or more advanced idea related to the week's topic
- a question and answer period as needed

#### Studio time

After the start of class period, there will be studio time during which the instructor and TA will be available for specific student requests for assistance in person or via the class Discord.

Attendance of the studio period is technically optional, but students are *very heavily encouraged* to take the time to connect with the instructor and TA and to work in the group setting. You learn by doing and you learn by getting help.


### Projects

There will be three graded projects, called "jams," during the course. Each will be used as an opportunity for students to practice and develop their programming skills with room to express their own ideas.

### Office hours

The instructor will be live on Discord for extra hours during the week explicitly to support students with questions about programming topics, activities, exercises, projects, and anything else of relevance.

## Expected skills

Students are **not** expected to have any existing familiarity with programming. However, excitement and willingness to learn are a must!

Students are further expected to be fully committed to engaging with programming as not just a technical but as a creative practice, constantly working to see ways in which the technical skills they are learning can be deployed in expressive and interesting ways and articulating those ideas both in code and speech/writing.

## Moodle

[Moodle](https://moodle.concordia.ca/) will be used for students to watch videos, submit work, and to receive grades and feedback.

## GitHub

You're reading this course outline on GitHub. You can either read it as a website by going to:

<https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/>

or as the actual GitHub repository it not-so-secretly is by going to

<https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/>

Students will also create their own repository on GitHub to save, track, and present their coursework. (Actual submission will be via Moodle, for privacy reasons.)

## Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) will be used as our common space for this course. Everyone will use their real name (or a recognizable nickname) as their nickname on the Discord so that we can get to know each other.

## Evaluation

Specific evaluation requirements will be provided when assigned. See the [Schedule](./schedule.md) for timing.

* [Pre-reflection](./evaluation/pre-reflection/) (10%)
* [Art Jam](./evaluation/art-jam/) (10%)
* [Mod Jam](./evaluation/mod-jam/) (20%)
* [Variations Jam](./evaluation/variation-jam/) (30%)
* [Post-reflection](./evaluation/post-reflection/) (10%)
* Participation (20%)
    * Participation includes: attending class, completing coursework, being present on the Discord, asking questions, contributing to discussions, sharing ideas, and coming to office hours, email   ing the instructor with updates on projects (even if you do not need help, make sure to touch base with the instructor regularly in some capacity)

## French

Students have the right to write in French at Concordia. Pippin can read French fairly well, but cannot offer substantive feedback on writing skill itself. Given that this is a programming course, you are welcome to name variables and functions in French as well as to write comments in French.

## Late work policy

Late work of any kind will lose one letter grade per day late, beginning immediately after the deadline (e.g. if it is two days late, work that would have received a B would lose two letter grades and receive a C+). 

**üî• Please get in touch with Pippin before a deadline passes if you think you won't make it üî•**

## Academic integrity

### Academic Ethics

The most common offence under the Academic Code of Conduct is plagiarism, which the Code defines as ‚Äúthe presentation of the work of another person as one‚Äôs own or without proper acknowledgement.‚Äù This includes material copied word for word from books, journals, Internet sites, professor‚Äôs course notes, etc. It refers to material that is paraphrased but closely resembles the original source. It also includes for example the work of a fellow student, an answer on a quiz, data for a lab report, a paper or assignment completed by another student. It might be a paper purchased from any source. Plagiarism does not refer to words alone ‚Äì it can refer to copying images, graphs, tables and ideas. ‚ÄúPresentation‚Äù is not limited to written work. It includes oral presentations, computer assignments and artistic works. Finally, if you translate the work of another person into any other language and do not cite the source, this is also plagiarism.

**In Simple Words:** Do not copy, paraphrase or translate anything from anywhere without saying where you obtained it. (Source: [Concordia's Academic Integrity Website](https://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity))

### Academic ethics when programming

When creating projects in code, make sure you attribute all elements that are not your own work, including images, sounds, and especially other people's code (provide notes and links to the original work either in a README, at the top of your script, on in the same place as the usage)

### Programming and AI

It is course policy that no student will use AI tools or similar to help them with their programming work. There is a great conversation to be had about these tools and we should have it, but the bottom line is that this course is about learning to code from the ground up.

## Costs

* See the [Department Syllabus](https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/finearts/design/docs/dcart-undergraduate-syllabus.pdf)
* All software students are expected to use in the class will be free.

## Technology

The practical work done in this class will take place on a lab computer or on your own computer, with course software installed on it by you. The instructor is significantly more experienced with macOS, but will work to support Windows and even Linux as needed. This course does not require a significantly powerful machine beyond the ability to run a web browser.

## Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces

The Department of Design and Computation Arts is committed to fostering an equitable and positive learning experience for all students, staff and faculty, free from discrimination based for example on race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, religion, ethnicity, age, etc. We value diversity and difference, and strive together to create safer spaces in our classrooms, studios, and labs, where all students can fully engage in scholarly and artistic pursuits, knowing that harmful behaviour (e.g. harassment, microaggressions, intolerance, disrespectful language, etc.) is unacceptable. We believe that celebrating difference is fundamental to supporting an academic community where innovation, creative exploration, and intellectual freedom can flourish.

## Behaviour
